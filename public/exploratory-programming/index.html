<p>In this page I gather all information I have written or gathered around
<em>exploratory programming</em>.</p>
<p>You can read what I mean by that in the <a href="https://blog.dziban.net/exploratory-programming/./essays/explorative-programming">original
essay</a> I wrote.</p>
<p>You can also check the
<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/igkrfa/explorative_programming">Lobste.rs</a> and
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39835343">Hacker News</a>
discussions around that essay.</p>
<p>Several tools have been brought to my attentions around the publishing
of the essay:</p>
<h2 id="interlisp">Interlisp</h2>
<p>The original OS of the Xerox Lisp Machines has some interesting ideas
that are very similar to what I thought about. Mainly related to
avoiding the File-based and file organization problems.</p>
<p>It was able to keep track of what was modified and what was new and
update the files with the new definitions. They called this the
&quot;resident mode&quot;. You can read more about this and other interlisp
goodies in
<a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;doi=b8f849085d608a657eea30f771b5a6de204a7f3f">these</a>
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/356715.356719">two</a> documents.</p>
<p>There's been a recent effort by the Medley Interslip organization to
port the original Interlisp into modern OSs, with people from the
original design involved. I'll write more about Interlisp in future
posts.</p>
<p>You can check Interlisp out on their <a href="https://interlisp.org">website</a>.
You can check the conversation where Interlisp was brought to my
attention
<a href="https://elk.zone/functional.cafe/@amoroso@fosstodon.org/112163251479658005">here</a>.
In the hacker news discussion there are also some references to Interlisp.
Make sure to check those as well :)</p>
<h2 id="pharo">Pharo</h2>
<p>A lot of people commented that what I was talking about was very much what
Smalltalk offered in many of their Desktop environments.</p>
<p>I really need to expand more into this and learn more about
<a href="https://pharo.org/">Pharo</a>. I've tested Pharo before a couple of
years ago, and while very interesting the transition from prototype to
production didn't seem the most straightforward. I need to give it a
deeper try, particularly around the prototyping stage (Although being
able to move into production is something that is necessary for me,
since it is also another source of rigidness).</p>
<h3 id="gtoolkit">GToolkit</h3>
<p>Implemented in Pharo, <a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">Glamorous Toolkit</a> is
something I really ought to give a try, it's some kind of
personalizable development environment, what they call a Moldable
Develeopment environment. Will be testing this soon and possibly write
an article about it! It looks incredibly interesting to develop custom
tooling around another language/system but as with Pharo, it cannot go
into production (to confirm).</p>
<p>It may be very interesting to draw inspiration from this though.</p>

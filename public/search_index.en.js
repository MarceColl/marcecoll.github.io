languages, we use a lot more tooling but the core remains\nmostly the same. Organizing code in text files, edit those files using a text editor, using those text \nfiles as input for an interpreter or compiler, check the files into a source control system.

I don't know about you, but I cannot really plan very well in advance and I need to explore\nthe problem space interactively to get a good hang on what the problem and the program is about.\nA lot of design of Common Lisp goes towards enabling this interactivity, CLOS the OOP library of Common Lisp allows you to redefine\nclasses at runtime and it will update existing instances with the new slots (properties). You can add and remove methods at runtime.\nYou can also code what updating the instances means if you want something more custom than what is the edefault.\nYou can redefine functions at runtime, the condition system allows interactivity when dealing with errors.

I'm sure a lot of other developers are in\nthat boat as well. I'd even venture to say that (almost?) all\ndevelopers have a hard time doing that even if they think they\nunderstand the problem. Well, that's probably actually the root of the\nissue. Without writing or tackling them, it's hard to understand\nproblems. You can only reach so far by thinking very hard in\nisolation.\nIn my case the only real way I can tackle a problem is to start\nwriting code and playing with the problem and its data. I can talk\nabout how I approach the process at another time, but I need to explore\nthe problem space to find its limits, its edge cases, what areas are well\nlit and which are in shadows. I cannot think of this in the abstract.\nI think I'm not alone in this. Hopefully?\nThe problem is that most development environments are not designed to\nhelp with the exploratory nature of this way of mapping a problem\nspace. They seem to be designed around what the end-program needs to\nlook like. Well-structured files in clean hierarchies and packaged\nwithin cleanly delimited interfaces and modules. Who can write those\nfrom the start? My guess is no-one.\nThere is a rigidness in our current development environments that\nmakes this important first step a lot harder than it should be. This\nrigidness actively works against us, and prevents us from\nunderstanding problems.\nRigidness\nWhat are the sources of this rigidness? I believe there are several and this\nis not a exhaustive list, just the ones that I find most annoying and the ones\nI've been looking for solutions for.\n\n\nLong feedback cycles, caused mainly by two things:\n\nBuild steps, if you need to recompile or rebuild the system,\nit incurs a cost everytime you try something new.\nLoss of program state, even if your language doesn't need a\nbuild step, most languages are not designed to keep your program\nstate evolving as you evolve the code and their data structures.\nThis is a huge source of friction, and it's a huge cost to pay\nevery time you wanna try something new.\n\n\n\nFile based organization, right from the start you need to start\ndeciding what goes where. Of course I think most of us start with a\nsingle file, full of random functions and tests. But at some point\nthis file becomes unbearable, impossible to find what you are\nlooking for. At that point you have to make decisions and start\nsplitting the file at logical points. Deal with what is private and\nwhat is not. It may not seem like much, but it's very annoying.\n\n\nBad system introspection, most languages require you to\nimplement text-based outputs for your internal data so you can\nactually inspect what is going on.\n\n\nBad solutions for tree-based exploration, there are usually\nseveral directions that look good when tackling a problem and once\nyou decide on one of them it's very costly to try the rest. The\nversion control systems we have are not designed for this kind of\nwork, they require the user to create snapshots when the user\nwants. If they have forgotten to do it at some point, that snapshot\nis lost. And I can just speak for my experience here, but while I'm\ndoing this exploratory work I never know what I wanna save and what\nnot and what avenue will be worth exploring. I don't wanna be\nthinking about any of that either.\n\n\nBad Collaboration Story, the same systems I talk about in the\nlast point are also the way we do collaboration in software\ndevelopment right now, tools like git or mercurial. If they are\na failure for tree-based exploration, then they cannot work to\ncollaborate on exploration. They are already lacking the needed\ninfo for collaborating.\n\n\nThis rigidness is creatin so much friction when it comes to tackling\nnew and complex problems, both alone and in small teams. It requires\nso much upfront investment that I think we are missing out on a lot of\nnew and interesting ideas because it's costly to do so.\nIf we had better exploratory programming tooling we could tackle\nmore complex problems with less people\nThere you go, that's my thesis. We need to have better, interactive,\nexploratory and playful development environments.\nA step in this direction\nRecently I've been spending more and more time writing Common Lisp\nafter years of writing Python, Rust, C and Javascript/Typescript.  And\nit's not only because of things like macros and definitely not because\nof the ecosystem. It's because it's the environment that more closely\nmatches my development process. The feedback cycle is immediate, it\nallows very good introspection of every object in the system, and it\nmakes a lot of effort to keep your program state after changing\nanything1.\nThe amazing thing about Common Lisp as a development environment is\nthat it covers the whole range, from exploring to production. It\ncovers the high level, live reloading, macro writing, interactive side\nand the performance-oriented, debugging, fast, robust side that you\nwant in order to deploy your systems.\nIt still requires you to use files, working in the REPL-only brings\nits own set of problems. REPL and files are hard to keep in\nsync. That's another thing that what I'm development helps with, if\nyou remove the files, there's nothing to keep in sync.\nAnd it offers no help for the last two points2 I made above.\nAn idea for what comes next\nI've started work on an alternative system. It's not currently in a\nusable state but it's in a working state and I'm fairly close to\ndogfooding it.\nI've decided to use Common Lisp as a base language for this\ndevelopment environment. I didn't want to have to create a whole\nlanguage from scratch to test out these ideas, I tend to get into\nuseless rabbitholes that detract from what I'm trying to do, not this\ntime. Common Lisp as I said already has what I consider to be the\nlocal maxima for my workflow and has the tools to extend the language\nin the direction I want. It's the perfect testing grounds.\nThere are two features I'm starting with in this system:\n\n\nNon-linear editing of the source Getting away from file based\norganization, you have a database of symbols and you can bring them\nand hide them as you please. There is a concept of a workspace,\nwhere you can see only the definitions for the symbols you need and\nnothing else. These workspaces can be saved and restored. That way\nyou can have different \"Notebooks\", depending on the problem you\nare solving, with only the definitions you need at any given time.\nThis solves the code organization problem and reduces the friction\nof starting something.\n\n\nPer-symbol history, we keep the history of every single version\nof functions, defvar, defparameter, defclass, defmacro, etc\nyou have created and sent to the REPL. You can navigate the tree,\ninspect the history, go back in time. This tree is built\nautomatically as you re-define any symbol. You can diff between\ndifferent states and even merge versions. This works at per-symbol\ngranularity. This attempts to solve point number 4. You can recurse\ninto design sub-trees and go back in time without needing to manage\nhistory manually.\n\n\nCurrently all of this is implemented by having all symbols in an\nSQLite database and with a custom Emacs mode. You have a tree of\ndefinitions and we have mappings of (package, symbol) -&gt; definition.\nCommon Lisp makes this extremely easy, packages are nothing more than\na bag of symbols, some public, some private and there are objects\nassigned to symbols. So we are working on the same package abstraction\nthat common lisp is already based on. Backed by a DB instead of\nin-memory in the Lisp listener. We don't even lose performance since\nCommon Lisp exposes the compile function to compile lambda forms.\nCollaborative Explorative Programming\nExpanding this idea a bit more, and to tackle point #5 we could\nreplace the SQLite with a shared database. Instead of having one set\nof mappings you could have one per user while having a shared history.\nIn order to do this having ways to delete, merge and search the\nhistory database would become needed since the amount of code could\nget unwieldy pretty fast. One interesting thing we could do to search\nfor valid history entries is to be able to create tests for a symbol,\nlocally but shareable and to be able to run those tests on all/some\nhistory entries. You could then see which ones match your\nspecification or for which tests it fails. It could help narrow down\nwhat parts of the tree were valid and which not. With this you could\neven dynamically query the history tree by creating ad-hoc predicates\nover inputs and outputs of the functions.\nOther interesting ways of developing in groups withh this could be to\nallow you to live-track the dev env of another user. Following the\nsame set of symbol mappings, you could even limit it to certain\nfunctions or function trees (if we kept track of which functions\ndepend on which functions). That way your friend could be working on\nfunction A while your work on function B and you both have constantly\nupdated versions of each others functions while you work on yours.\nThis is not implemented for now, but it would be a natural\nextension to the system.\nLive deploy\nAnother interesting thing that we could develop is the ability to\ndeploy code on a live instance in a way that automatically rolls back\nif too many errors happen.\nThis maybe is too crazy, since there is a reason why we've converged\ninto deploying dumb stateless services in docker images. We don't wanna\ndeal with a changing environment. But, is it really that different?\nImagine a service that never stops, you diff the existing functions\nwith the new functions, only updating what needs to be updated. If\nthere is a change in the rate of errors then you automatically\nrollback the deployed functions.  A smarter system could even track\nwhich functions changed their error rate and only rollback any\nfunction that is related in that execution tree that changed in the\nlast deploy.\nIt gets harder to track, but maybe it's possible.\nConcerns and worries\nI have two main worries and areas of the system that I'm unsure how I'll tackle:\n\n\nHow to interact/merge this methodology in existing systems that are\nfile based in a way that doesn't add a lot of friction back.\n\n\nAt the top-level of any common lisp program there may be\nexpressions not associated with a symbol. I'm very unsure how to\ntackle that if at all. I tend to always wrap everything in\nfunctions anyway, but I don't want to impose a particular way of\nprogramming if you wanna use the tool. I need to give this more thought.\n\n\nAnd the final worry, which I think a lot of us have when tackling a\nnew design space:\n\nWhy hasn't been done yet before? Is it a bad idea? Does it have\nhidden complexities that make it impractical? Do people not develop\nlike this? Will the idea not be as useful as I expect?\n\nI guess there is only one way to know :)\nConclusion\nThis is a topic very dear to my heart, it has taken me many years to\ncome to understand how I best develop software. I'm not a very\nintrospective person in general and it has been a long journey.\nHopefuly some of it was interesting and I look forward to learn more\nabout if these ideas resonate with you and what the problems may be.\nI will write another post at some point to show how all this works\nfrom within. It is actually surprisingly small because of the amount\nof tools that CL gives the user, but there are some interesting\nchallenges nontheless.\n1\nCLOS evolves the instances of any class you define as you evolve the class definition\n\n2\nI guess you could have two people remotely controlling the same\nrepl through swank, but that would get unwieldy quickly\n\n","id":"https://blog.dziban.net/essays/explorative-programming/","title":"Explorative Programming"},"https://blog.dziban.net/exploratory-programming/":{"body":"In this page I gather all information I have written or gathered around\nexploratory programming.\nYou can read what I mean by that in the original\nessay I wrote.\nYou can also check the\nLobste.rs and\nHacker News\ndiscussions around that essay.\nSeveral tools have been brought to my attentions around the publishing\nof the essay:\nInterlisp\nThe original OS of the Xerox Lisp Machines has some interesting ideas\nthat are very similar to what I thought about.

It looks incredibly interesting to develop custom\ntooling around another language/system but as with Pharo, it cannot go\ninto production (to confirm).\nIt may be very interesting to draw inspiration from this though.\n","id":"https://blog.dziban.net/exploratory-programming/","title":""},"https://blog.dziban.net/posts/":{"body":"","id":"https://blog.dziban.net/posts/","title":""},"https://blog.dziban.net/posts/delivering-a-lispworks-application/":{"body":"WARNING: This is a living document. As I understand more of the\nLispWorks delivery system i'll add more.\nChangelog\n2024-04-02 - Added article\nLispWorks\nI recently got my LispWorks HobbyistDV\nlicense in order to productionize a couple of my Common Lisp application\ndevelopment. SBCL is amazing but as I am planning to develop a couple\nof services that may potentially get into commercial territory I\nwanted to get familiar with the commercial CL implementations in case\nI need them. The IDE and CAPI are also amazing and I've already\ndeveloped a couple of personal GUIs to help me with some of my\nworkflows.\nYesterday I set out to deliver my first server application, let's\nbuild our understanding bit by bit.\nLispWorks has extensive\ndocumentation\non the delivery system. You can check there for more details.\nThe Delivery System\nThe LW delivery system allows you to take a common lisp application\nand generate a self-contained binary with everything it needs to run.\nThe system basically takes an image (lisp program state in memory) and\nturns it into an executable that contains the necessary LispWorks\nruntime to run it. This already gives us a hint of what we will have\nto do. We have to setup the image at build time.\nThe deliver script\nThe deliver script is a lisp file that does just that, it sets up the\nimage as you need it for your final program. Here you load all your\ncode, all your dependencies, enable any features you need (we'll get\nto that later), and finally call the deliver function with some\nparameters. You do mostly as you do when you start a lisp repl to work\non some project.\nThe simplest deliver script could be something like this:\n\nWe define a main function to be our application code and call\ndelivery with some parameters we'll explore later. In this case we\nare not loading any external application code, just defining a\nfunction.\nNow we can ask LW to build this and run the resulting binary\n\nThis is quite easy. Let's check what those arguments to deliver\nmean. The first argument, #'main in the above script, is the entry\npoint, the function that will be called when running the resulting\nbinary. The second one (\"./app\") is the path for the binary that\nwill be generated. The third one (0) is how hard we want LispWorks\nto try to make our image smaller and it's called level\ninternally.. It is a number from 0 to 5, and the higher the level the\nmore runtime LispWorks removes. It also applies some optimizations\nlike converting methods into functions in some cases and stuff like\nthat. Cool!\nLet's check what was the size of the generated app binary.\n\n47MB is pretty big for a simple print, let's ask LispWorks to reduce\nit, let's set the level to 5 and rebuild.\n\nRuh. Roh. What's going on here? By default LispWorks creates functions\nas interpreted functions, when tree shaking the image LispWorks also\nremoved the ability to eval functions since it expects everything to\nbe compiled.\nWe can do two things here:\nEither add the :KEEP-EVAL T to the deliver arguments, or add\n(compile 'main) before the call to deliver. In both cases the\nimage doesn't increase in size too much. It stays in 7,9M, so it\ndoesn't really matter. It also depends in what your application\nuses. If you rely on runtime eval then you will want to :KEEP-EVAL T \nanyway. If you are loding your code with quicklisp this is usually\nhandled for you, since quicklisp uses compile-file.\nThis exemplifies a bit more how the delivery system works. It\nliterally takes the image state as is and depending on the level it\nremoves as many features as possible to reduce the image size, this\nmay break some of your code that relies on features that have been\nremoved. There are very little build checks to make sure the\napplication will work after very aggressive tree shaking!\nUnless you have a particular need to reduce the image further I\nrecommend starting with level 0 or 1 if that's enough, since it's less\nlikely some feature you depend on will be removed. If you do need a\nhigher level, deliver has a lot of flags to control what is and what\nis not removed, make sure to check those out and test the resulting\nbinary extensively.\nThis is unlike any other system I've worked with and I think it's\nimportant to highlight it. Most systems build stage is about code\nbuilding and state is usually left for a separate step or at\ninitialization time. Of course there are ways to do it but they get\nhairy quite fast. Because of how image-based builds work, you can\nbuild state at this stage. Anything you do, variables you set, hash\ntables you fill, trees you generate will get embedded in the resulting\nimage.\nThis means that precomputing something is not only feasible but easy\nto do if needed. To me is a little bit analogous to functions vs\nmacros, where you can do computation at compile time instead of\nruntime. I've done similar things with rust, but it always feels\nnon-native and hacky, I want to explore a little bit more what can be\ndone with this in the future.\nA more complex example\nThis is the deliver script for an application I'm building:\n\nThis application is basically a web server that can contain multiple\nsites. Let's break it down\n\nThis loads two features of LispWorks that we want for the final image,\nthe remote debugger (explained in the next section) and tty-inspect\nto be able to run (inspect *) in the application. When run from a\nnormal listener, inspect automatically loads this feature when\nexecuted. However we cannot do that in the resulting executable since\nwe will have removed it.\n\nFairly self-explanatory, I setup quicklisp and then use it to load my\nsystem. This makes sure that both my code and all the dependencies\nwill be availabe in the resulting image.\n\nThis is a helper function that goes over everything in the sites/\nfolder and loads it using quicklisp. Making sure that the code for the\nsites and all their dependencies are available in the image. This is\nneeded since compile-file is not available at runtime in the\ndelivered applications.\n\nSmall code snippet that saves the date and the commit in the\nami.config:*build* variable. Here you can see an example of\nstate building in the image. A very simple one though.\n\nFinally calling deliver, apart from the arguments we have already\nlooked at we've added some keyword arguments to control what is kept\nand what isn't.\n:multiprocessing is off by default unless it's a CAPI\napplication. As this application uses hunchentoot it needs\nmultiprocessing to run all the handler threads.\n:delete-packages '(ql) removes quicklisp form the resulting image\nsince I don't need runtime quicklisp support. Quicklisp is actually\nquite useless at runtime in delivered applications since LispWorks\nremoves the compile-file function.\n:keep-pretty-printer t is needed for tty-inspect to work, since it\nneeds to pretty print objects.\nRemote Debugging on delivered applications\nThere is one thing that is pretty bad of delivered applications, they\ncannot run slynk/swank servers. The server runs fine but they depend\non compile-file and that is unconditionally removed in all delivered\napplications (I think it's because they don't want you creating a\ncompeting product to LispWorks using their own tools). Sadly not even\nthe sly repl works.\nThankfully they do have a solution to at least part of what sly\noffers.  You can not change code on the fly on a delivered image, but\nyou can at least open a listener and a debugger to a delivered\napplication.\nYou can setup either the IDE or the application to be the debugger\nserver, in my case I've setup the application to be the server since\nit will be always running and I can connect from somewhere else with\nmy IDE. Let's see how that works.\nYou have to first load the remote-debugger-client feature in the\ndeliver script. Then you need to startup the server somewhere in your\ninitialization tree:\n\nThis starts a tcp server at the default port (21102, you can change it\nwith the :port keyword arg).\nThen from the IDE you need to (require \"remote-debugger-full\") and\n(dbg:ide-connect-remote-debugging \"host\" :open-a-listener t).\nThis will connect at the default port on the given host and open a\nlistener window connected to that application.\nPackage Troubleshooting\nAs I find problems delivering some packages I'll add them here as\nreference.\nClack/Lack\nClack/Lack loads middleware dynamically at runtime using quicklisp.\nYou need to explicitly add the middlewares as dependencies in the asdf\nsystem so the are loaded with the main system. Or else you'll get\nquicklisp errors when running the application.\nFor example:\n\nIt also loads the backend server dynamically, so when you run it on\nthe repl it's possible everything runs correctly since it will load\nhunchentoot for you, but you need to depend on it explicitly for a\ndelivered application.\nThe End\n","id":"https://blog.dziban.net/posts/delivering-a-lispworks-application/","title":"Delivering a LispWorks application"},"https://blog.dziban.net/posts/lispworks-eval-in-lexenv/":{"body":"One of the things that surprised me when I learned Common Lisp was\nthat eval happens in the nil lexical environment1. This means\nthat none of the lexical variables, functions or macros surrounding\nthe eval are available within the evaluated form.\nTake this example:\n\nThe reason why that surprised me is that one of the first things that\nI tried when I learned about lisp symbolic capabilities was to build a\nsymbolic\ndifferentiator. You'd give\nit a function, it would symbolically compute the derivative using\nthe chain rule and then evaluate it. I built a very basic one with\nonly a couple of rules to test the idea and it seemed to work, the\nproblem was when I wanted to evaluate the resulting form.\nWhat I attempted was something like this:\n\nIf you try this of course you'll face the same issue we found above.\nError: The variable X is unbound. I was confused, I thought symbolic\ncomputation WAS the point of Lisp. At that point I learned about the\ndynamic vs lexical environment and I started making sense of what I\nwas seeing, but I was frustrated and it seemed that what I wanted to\ndo was impossible.\nIndeed, you could do it with a macro, but then you cannot pass it\narbitrary functions at runtime, everything has to be predefined.\nAnother option was available which was to declare x as special2,\nbut then you needed to define some special variables, and the\nexpressions could only use those. It would work but it was not ideal.\nAt that point I stopped, frustrated, and learned other parts of the\nlanguage. Recently I had a need for something similar again and so I\nset to find a solution now that I had some more Common Lisp experience\nunder my belt.\nPROGV\nPROGV is a Common Lisp\nspecial form that takes three or more arguments, a list of dynamic\nbindings to create, a list of values to set the bindings to and any\nnumber of forms. The forms are evaluated in order with the given \ndynamic bindings set.\n\nWith this we can emulate a en eval in a lexical env by setting\neverything we have in the lexical environment as a dynamic variable\ninside a PROGV and then executing the eval. It will behave as if\nit was running on the lexenv.\nThis would be a good moment to see where we are going:\n\nWhich behind the scenes would be transformed into a PROGV form:\n\nNow the problem is, eval-in-lexenv cannot modify its surroundings,\nmacros are powerful but not THAT powerful3. We could ask the\nusers to do something like this:\n\nAnd then build a code walker, check bindings inside, capture some\nbindings from outside, etc. But that is very complicated and there are\nprobably plenty of edge cases and problems, it's far too complicated\nand too alien for the user to be worth it in this case.\nIntrospecting the lexical environment\nDEFMACRO's arglist has a hidden gem that I overlooked the first time\nI checked the documentation. With &amp;environment we can ask the lisp\ncompiler to give us the lexical environment4 at the macro call site.\nFor example\n\nIt contains variables, functions, blocks and tags in the lexical\nenvironment. But, I'm pretty sure this struct is internal and the\nintrface may not be stable. Re-reading the LispWorks documentation\ntoday I found this function:\nSYSTEM:MAP-ENVIRONMENT.\nWith this function you can introspect everything in the lexical\nenvironment you pass as an argument. Let's write a function to get all\nvariable names in the lexical environment for example.\n\nPretty self-explanatory, ask lispworks to map over all the variables,\nand then we push them into a list. We filter them by :LEXICAL type\nbecause we are also given dynamic variables that have been overwritten\nin the current lexical scope, but we don't need to use those since\nthey are already in the dynamic scope.\nNow let's create the pièce de résistance, the eval-in-lexenv\nmacro:\n\nShort and sweet, we get all the lexical variables, then we pass them\nboth as names and values to PROGV. As names we pass them quoted, so\nwe get bind the same symbols we have of lexical vars as dynamic\nvariables, for values we pass them unquoted inside of a (LIST ...)\nso they get evaluated and capture the values from the surrounding\nlexical env, thus setting the dynamic variables to the same values.\nThere you go, a way to eval in the lexical environment in about 14\nlines of easy to understand common lisp code. This code is LispWorks\nexclusive tho, but I'm sure there are ways to do it in SBCL, since\n&amp;environment works there as well. I may add it in the future if\nsomeone sends me a solution that works in SBCL.\nLimitations\nThis implementation doesn't allow using functions and macros from the\nlexical env (as defined by MACROLET or FLET) although there are\nways around it, like binding the function to a variable and using\nFUNCALL or APPLY inside the eval.\n\nAnother thing is that this macro depends on being called at the\nlexical environment you want to evaluate it.\nIf you try to call this macro from within the body of a macro function\nyou'll be capturing the call environment inside the macro. Of course\nif you use it as part of the unevaluated returned form of the macro\neverything will work as expected, since that will be evaluated in the\ncorrect lexical environment.\nSETF shenanigans\nThere is a question I have for readers, because there is a bit of a\npuzzling behaviour I've seen with this implementation in LispWorks.\nWhen using eval-in-lexenv, if inside the evaled expression you\nsetf one of the lexical environment variables, that setf escapes to\nthe actual lexical environment instead of being contained to the\nPROGV. Does anyone know why that is the case? Can someone try it in\nanother implementation?\nExample:\n\nThis is very confusing to me, because it's something that I wanted and\nI was checking how to implement it, but it seems at least in LispWorks\nit works by default but I'm not sure why it works, since in there you\nshould be setting the dynamic variable inside the PROGV and not the\nlexical variable (since you don't even have access to the lexical one\nanyway).\nThe End\n1\nThe nil lexical environment, as the name says has no bindings at all\n\n2\nSpecial and dynamic variables are the same thing, special variables are variables bound in the dynamic environment\n\n3\nRecently I learned about a term rewriting lisp, which could actually do things like this potentially. I think that particular version is not quite powerful enough for this, but there is no reason it couldn't I think.\n\n4\nI think it's not only the lexical environment, but the general environment that overlays the dynamic environment, it also contains special variables overriden in the current lexical environment for example.\n\n","id":"https://blog.dziban.net/posts/lispworks-eval-in-lexenv/","title":"Eval using the lexical environment in LispWorks"},"https://blog.dziban.net/posts/small-vms-and-coroutines/":{"body":"TL;MDWR\nIn this post I'll talk about the implementation of the coroutine system in x64 asm for a game I'm writing.\n(Disclaimer: I'm very new at x64 assembly programming, so I may be doing some very stupid things)\nBackground\nI've had this idea for a while of a programmable game. I'm not gonna go into details for now but the main idea\nis a Real-time strategy game (RTS) where you can program every unit. The code of the units runs in a very simple \nfantasy stack virtual machine, and every tick each unit gets to execute a certain amount of instructions\nbased on their virtual CPU speed.\nAs this is an RTS, lots of units are running at the same time and so we need a way to efficiently run all of these\nunits at a speed reasonable for an interactive videogame (60fps). Some years ago I did some tests around this idea and the VMs \nI came up with were underperforming messes of either rust or C. There was no way I could deliver the performance I \nhad in mind with that.\nRecently while reading the first volume of The Art of Computer Programming \nI came across a section when Knuth implements coroutines in his MIX machine. And, while I had heard and used \ncoroutines informaly all the time in my career I had never seen it like this. For those who don't know, a coroutine\nis a kind of subroutine that can be suspended and resumed, they are like concurrent-less threads. Each coroutine\nhas it's own stack and instruction pointer. You may have encountered asymmetrical coroutines in the form of python \ngenerators for example. If you need more context please check the coroutine page at wikipedia\nSo I had two ideas at about the same time, convert the code of the Fantasy VM to x64 asm code and run to the code for the\nunit VMs as tiny individual coroutines. This both avoids expensive thread context switches, and completely removes the need for\ncoordinating. I still have to run some benchmarks but I believe splitting the VMs by power (lots of small units in a thread,\nsome powerful units in another) may bring the best performance results. I may create a separate blogpost once I benchmark this\nproperly.\nSo let's get started!\nFantasy ASM to x64 ASM\nThe first one seems very obvious in hindsight, why spend time implementing the VM when the CPU it is running on already\nimplements most of the things I want? With some simple macros I can even mostly feed the Fantasy ISA program into an assembler and it\nwill come out as expected.\nLet's work with a very reduced version of the VM instruction set, just three simple instructions:\nInstrDescription\nPUSHPush immediate to stack\nADDAdd the top two items of the stack. Place result on stack\nJMPJump to label\n\nLet's create a very dumb program with this:\n\nIt basically adds 0x01 constantly to a value on the stack, forever. It's an infinite loop.\nNow we can use an assembler with macro support to implement these operations in x64. I'll be using fasm for this.\n\nSeveral things to note, I'm using inc rax in every instruction because I want a way to know how many virtual instructions have executed in order\nto impose limits on number of instructions per tick. rax holds this counter. JMP and PUSH are exactly the same instruction as the x64 counterpart, they map 1 to 1. \nADD is very simple as well: use bx as a temporary storage for the top value of the stack, add the top value of the stack with bx and store in \nback to the top of the stack.\nWith these macros in place, passing the Fantasy ISA input to fasm already gives us a valid x64 program. The result of the macro expansion would look\nlike this:\n\nIn very few lines we have an assembler for our fantasy VM to native x64 code! Now, currently this will loop forever and we don't want that, this is where\ncoroutines come and save the day.\nCoroutines\nHow do we make sure that the unit vm only executes N instructions before it suspends itself? A pretty lightweight solution that requires very little setup\nis to insert a check that we haven't exceeded the number of operations every K ops and after every label (in the unit VM you can only jump to labels, \nso we catch all loops, branches and sketchy stuff with this).\n\nI know that this doesn't ensure that the VMs execute exactly N operations, but I think it is a pretty good tradeoff between code size, execution\noverhead and constraining the number of ops. I'll show one possible mitigation further down.\n\nSo how do we implement these lightweight unit coroutines?\nFirst we need to save several things per coroutine:\n\ncurrent stack pointer (rsp)\ncurrent instruction pointer (rip)\ncurrent rax where we save the amount of instructions executed\ncurrent rbx that is used for some temporal values, this one is not strictly needed and there is a chance I remove it in the future\n\nUsually these things are saved in the stack with normal coroutines but we don't want to taint the stack of the unit vms with unrelated data.\nFirst because that means their stack gets reduced for reasons unrelated to their code, second because they may be able to manipulate the stack\nto the point where they override the values, and then all hell breaks loose. \nLet's start with a simple example where we have 10 units, so let's allocate 40 (4 fields * 10 coroutines) 64-bit values and 800 bytes of \ntotal stack (80 per coroutine).\n\nand initialize the data in them:\n\nNow let's loop over the coroutines, when we yield to the first one we will wait until it yields control back to the main loop, then it will\ncontinue on to the second, and so on. While you read the next code fragment, always keep in mind that all across the execution rcx always points to the\ncurrently active coroutine data. \n\nNow all the magic seems to happen in this YIELD macro, let's take a look:\n\nThere are probably some better ways to implement this, but this is what I came up with. Each call into a coroutine saves the main coroutine state\ninto the _co_data of the coroutine you YIELD into. Once YIELD is called from the other coroutine the same thing will happen, the values for \nthe main one will be restored and the execution will continue right after the ret. This works very well for our case of a main coroutine coordinating\nother coroutines.\nThere is one last piece left, injecting some instructions to check if we've exhausted our instruction limit this tick. To do so I created this macro:\n\nand we can modify the original program like so:\n\nSome small notes\nThis coroutine implementation is very specific. For general purpose coroutines you'd have to save some more registers than rip, rsp, rax and rbx.\nThis works in this case because I've assigned a very specific meaning to each register that works all across the implementation, this allows for a smaller\nand faster switching between coroutines than a general version.\nAnother thing is that right now this is very static, but I think it's fairly simple to see how to make it dynamic on the number of coroutines and having\ndifferent starting labels for each coroutine.\nRight now with the implementation I've shown there is no stack security to simplify the idea, but of course the PUSH and POP instructions should have\nboundary checks.\nAnother point is that the inc rax for every operation may add too much overhead, another option that I need to explore is adding an add rax, &lt;immediate&gt;\nright before any jump operation. I believe this should be enough to reduce the overhead and it should cover all cases but I need to investigate further.\nThe End\nHope this was informative and clear, if you have any question or you wanna talk, please let me know at marce [at] dziban.net.\n","id":"https://blog.dziban.net/posts/small-vms-and-coroutines/","title":"Small VMs & Coroutines"}},"docInfo":{"https://blog.dziban.net/":{"body":53,"title":1},"https://blog.dziban.net/blog/":{"body":0,"title":3},"https://blog.dziban.net/blog/first/":{"body":167,"title":3},"https://blog.dziban.net/essays/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://blog.dziban.net/essays/explorative-programming/":{"body":1062,"title":2},"https://blog.dziban.net/exploratory-programming/":{"body":197,"title":0},"https://blog.dziban.net/posts/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://blog.dziban.net/posts/delivering-a-lispworks-application/":{"body":811,"title":3},"https://blog.dziban.net/posts/lispworks-eval-in-lexenv/":{"body":575,"title":5},"https://blog.dziban.net/posts/small-vms-and-coroutines/":{"body":740,"title":3}},"length":10},"lang":"English"};

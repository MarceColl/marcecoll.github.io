Once you have\nsomething you like you commit it, and at some point generate a build and deploy it.\nThere are of course differences between environments and what you can do in them, but these are mostly the\nsame.\nA Survey of Interactive Development\nAt this point, for me there is no better development system than interactive programmming, perfectly exemplified\nby one of the Lisps, my lisp of choice is Common Lisp and everytime I refer to Lisp in this essay I'm refering to it\nbut probably a lot of this applies to any other Lisp.\nThe ability to continuously evolve the state and the code of the program while doing exploratory programming is\nTHE superpower of Lisp in my opinion. I don't know about you, but I cannot really plan very well in advance and I need to explore\nthe problem space interactively to get a good hang on what the problem and the program is about.\nA lot of design of Common Lisp goes towards enabling this interactivity, CLOS the OOP library of Common Lisp allows you to redefine\nclasses at runtime and it will update existing instances with the new slots (properties). You can add and remove methods at runtime.\nYou can also code what updating the instances means if you want something more custom than what is the edefault.\nYou can redefine functions at runtime, the condition system allows interactivity when dealing with errors.

I'm sure a lot of other developers are in\nthat boat as well. I'd even venture to say that (almost?) all\ndevelopers have a hard time doing that even if they think they\nunderstand the problem. Well, that's probably actually the root of the\nissue. Without writing or tackling them, it's hard to understand\nproblems. You can only reach so far by thinking very hard in\nisolation.\nIn my case the only real way I can tackle a problem is to start\nwriting code and playing with the problem and its data. I can talk\nabout how I approach the process at another time, but I need to explore\nthe problem space to find its limits, its edge cases, what areas are well\nlit and which are in shadows. I cannot think of this in the abstract.\nI think I'm not alone in this.

They seem to be designed around what the end-program needs to\nlook like. Well-structured files in clean hierarchies and packaged\nwithin cleanly delimited interfaces and modules. Who can write those\nfrom the start? My guess is no-one.\nThere is a rigidness in our current development environments that\nmakes this important first step a lot harder than it should be. This\nrigidness actively works against us, and prevents us from\nunderstanding problems.\nRigidness\nWhat are the sources of this rigidness? I believe there are several and this\nis not a exhaustive list, just the ones that I find most annoying and the ones\nI've been looking for solutions for.\n\n\nLong feedback cycles, caused mainly by two things:\n\nBuild steps, if you need to recompile or rebuild the system,\nit incurs a cost everytime you try something new.\nLoss of program state, even if your language doesn't need a\nbuild step, most languages are not designed to keep your program\nstate evolving as you evolve the code and their data structures.\nThis is a huge source of friction, and it's a huge cost to pay\nevery time you wanna try something new.\n\n\n\nFile based organization, right from the start you need to start\ndeciding what goes where. Of course I think most of us start with a\nsingle file, full of random functions and tests. But at some point\nthis file becomes unbearable, impossible to find what you are\nlooking for. At that point you have to make decisions and start\nsplitting the file at logical points. Deal with what is private and\nwhat is not. It may not seem like much, but it's very annoying.\n\n\nBad system introspection, most languages require you to\nimplement text-based outputs for your internal data so you can\nactually inspect what is going on.\n\n\nBad solutions for tree-based exploration, there are usually\nseveral directions that look good when tackling a problem and once\nyou decide on one of them it's very costly to try the rest. The\nversion control systems we have are not designed for this kind of\nwork, they require the user to create snapshots when the user\nwants. If they have forgotten to do it at some point, that snapshot\nis lost. And I can just speak for my experience here, but while I'm\ndoing this exploratory work I never know what I wanna save and what\nnot and what avenue will be worth exploring. I don't wanna be\nthinking about any of that either.\n\n\nBad Collaboration Story, the same systems I talk about in the\nlast point are also the way we do collaboration in software\ndevelopment right now, tools like git or mercurial. If they are\na failure for tree-based exploration, then they cannot work to\ncollaborate on exploration. They are already lacking the needed\ninfo for collaborating.\n\n\nThis rigidness is creatin so much friction when it comes to tackling\nnew and complex problems, both alone and in small teams. It requires\nso much upfront investment that I think we are missing out on a lot of\nnew and interesting ideas because it's costly to do so.\nIf we had better exploratory programming tooling we could tackle\nmore complex problems with less people\nThere you go, that's my thesis. We need to have better, interactive,\nexploratory and playful development environments.\nA step in this direction\nRecently I've been spending more and more time writing Common Lisp\nafter years of writing Python, Rust, C and Javascript/Typescript.  And\nit's not only because of things like macros and definitely not because\nof the ecosystem. It's because it's the environment that more closely\nmatches my development process. The feedback cycle is immediate, it\nallows very good introspection of every object in the system, and it\nmakes a lot of effort to keep your program state after changing\nanything1.\nThe amazing thing about Common Lisp as a development environment is\nthat it covers the whole range, from exploring to production. It\ncovers the high level, live reloading, macro writing, interactive side\nand the performance-oriented, debugging, fast, robust side that you\nwant in order to deploy your systems.\nIt still requires you to use files, working in the REPL-only brings\nits own set of problems. REPL and files are hard to keep in\nsync. That's another thing that what I'm development helps with, if\nyou remove the files, there's nothing to keep in sync.\nAnd it offers no help for the last two points2 I made above.\nAn idea for what comes next\nI've started work on an alternative system. It's not currently in a\nusable state but it's in a working state and I'm fairly close to\ndogfooding it.\nI've decided to use Common Lisp as a base language for this\ndevelopment environment. I didn't want to have to create a whole\nlanguage from scratch to test out these ideas, I tend to get into\nuseless rabbitholes that detract from what I'm trying to do, not this\ntime. Common Lisp as I said already has what I consider to be the\nlocal maxima for my workflow and has the tools to extend the language\nin the direction I want. It's the perfect testing grounds.\nThere are two features I'm starting with in this system:\n\n\nNon-linear editing of the source Getting away from file based\norganization, you have a database of symbols and you can bring them\nand hide them as you please. There is a concept of a workspace,\nwhere you can see only the definitions for the symbols you need and\nnothing else. These workspaces can be saved and restored. That way\nyou can have different \"Notebooks\", depending on the problem you\nare solving, with only the definitions you need at any given time.\nThis solves the code organization problem and reduces the friction\nof starting something.\n\n\nPer-symbol history, we keep the history of every single version\nof functions, defvar, defparameter, defclass, defmacro, etc\nyou have created and sent to the REPL. You can navigate the tree,\ninspect the history, go back in time. This tree is built\nautomatically as you re-define any symbol. You can diff between\ndifferent states and even merge versions. This works at per-symbol\ngranularity. This attempts to solve point number 4. You can recurse\ninto design sub-trees and go back in time without needing to manage\nhistory manually.\n\n\nCurrently all of this is implemented by having all symbols in an\nSQLite database and with a custom Emacs mode. You have a tree of\ndefinitions and we have mappings of (package, symbol) -&gt; definition.\nCommon Lisp makes this extremely easy, packages are nothing more than\na bag of symbols, some public, some private and there are objects\nassigned to symbols. So we are working on the same package abstraction\nthat common lisp is already based on. Backed by a DB instead of\nin-memory in the Lisp listener. We don't even lose performance since\nCommon Lisp exposes the compile function to compile lambda forms.\nCollaborative Explorative Programming\nExpanding this idea a bit more, and to tackle point #5 we could\nreplace the SQLite with a shared database. Instead of having one set\nof mappings you could have one per user while having a shared history.\nIn order to do this having ways to delete, merge and search the\nhistory database would become needed since the amount of code could\nget unwieldy pretty fast. One interesting thing we could do to search\nfor valid history entries is to be able to create tests for a symbol,\nlocally but shareable and to be able to run those tests on all/some\nhistory entries. You could then see which ones match your\nspecification or for which tests it fails. It could help narrow down\nwhat parts of the tree were valid and which not. With this you could\neven dynamically query the history tree by creating ad-hoc predicates\nover inputs and outputs of the functions.\nOther interesting ways of developing in groups withh this could be to\nallow you to live-track the dev env of another user. Following the\nsame set of symbol mappings, you could even limit it to certain\nfunctions or function trees (if we kept track of which functions\ndepend on which functions). That way your friend could be working on\nfunction A while your work on function B and you both have constantly\nupdated versions of each others functions while you work on yours.\nThis is not implemented for now, but it would be a natural\nextension to the system.\nLive deploy\nAnother interesting thing that we could develop is the ability to\ndeploy code on a live instance in a way that automatically rolls back\nif too many errors happen.\nThis maybe is too crazy, since there is a reason why we've converged\ninto deploying dumb stateless services in docker images. We don't wanna\ndeal with a changing environment. But, is it really that different?\nImagine a service that never stops, you diff the existing functions\nwith the new functions, only updating what needs to be updated. If\nthere is a change in the rate of errors then you automatically\nrollback the deployed functions.  A smarter system could even track\nwhich functions changed their error rate and only rollback any\nfunction that is related in that execution tree that changed in the\nlast deploy.\nIt gets harder to track, but maybe it's possible.\nConcerns and worries\nI have two main worries and areas of the system that I'm unsure how I'll tackle:\n\n\nHow to interact/merge this methodology in existing systems that are\nfile based in a way that doesn't add a lot of friction back.\n\n\nAt the top-level of any common lisp program there may be\nexpressions not associated with a symbol. I'm very unsure how to\ntackle that if at all. I tend to always wrap everything in\nfunctions anyway, but I don't want to impose a particular way of\nprogramming if you wanna use the tool. I need to give this more thought.\n\n\nAnd the final worry, which I think a lot of us have when tackling a\nnew design space:\n\nWhy hasn't been done yet before? Is it a bad idea? Does it have\nhidden complexities that make it impractical? Do people not develop\nlike this? Will the idea not be as useful as I expect?\n\nI guess there is only one way to know :)\nConclusion\nThis is a topic very dear to my heart, it has taken me many years to\ncome to understand how I best develop software. I'm not a very\nintrospective person in general and it has been a long journey.\nHopefuly some of it was interesting and I look forward to learn more\nabout if these ideas resonate with you and what the problems may be.\nI will write another post at some point to show how all this works\nfrom within. It is actually surprisingly small because of the amount\nof tools that CL gives the user, but there are some interesting\nchallenges nontheless.\n1\nCLOS evolves the instances of any class you define as you evolve the class definition\n\n2\nI guess you could have two people remotely controlling the same\nrepl through swank, but that would get unwieldy quickly\n\n","id":"https://blog.dziban.net/essays/explorative-programming/","title":"Explorative Programming"}},"docInfo":{"https://blog.dziban.net/":{"body":36,"title":0},"https://blog.dziban.net/blog/":{"body":0,"title":3},"https://blog.dziban.net/blog/first/":{"body":167,"title":3},"https://blog.dziban.net/essays/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://blog.dziban.net/essays/explorative-programming/":{"body":1062,"title":2}},"length":5},"lang":"English"};
